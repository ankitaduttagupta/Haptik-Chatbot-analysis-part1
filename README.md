# Haptik-Chatbot-analysis-using-NLP      

Haptik is one of the world's largest conversational AI platforms. It is a personal assistant mobile app, powered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human assistance. It has its domain in multiple fields including customer support, feedback, order status and live chat.

Here is a dataset of Haptik containing the messages it receives from the customers and which topic(class) the messages refer to.

## About the project: 
- Created a model predicting which class a particular message belongs to using NLP. 
- Used  Gensim for topic modeling techniques like 
  1. LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) 
  2. LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) 
- Used supervised learning algorithms like :
  1. Logistic regression:
  2. Multinomial Naive Bayes
  3. Linear SVM
- Evaluated LDA model using perplexity and coherence score
- Topic visualization using pyLDAvis, wordcloud
